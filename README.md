# Phrase Testing Project

This project is aimed at testing and refining the phrase detection capabilities of a voice recognition access control system. The primary focus is to ensure that the system can accurately detect and verify specific phrases spoken by users.

## Features

- **Phrase Detection:** Captures and analyzes spoken phrases for authentication.
- **Noise Reduction:** Implements filters to enhance phrase detection accuracy.
- **Precise Matching:** Ensures that the system only accepts correct and complete phrases.

## Files

- `phrases.py`: This script contains the core logic for capturing, processing, and verifying spoken phrases.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amitrajputfff/Phrase_Testing.git
    cd Phrase_Testing
    ```

2. Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the `phrases.py` script to start testing.

    ```bash
    python3 phrases.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to speak the required phrases. The system will analyze the input and provide feedback on the detection accuracy.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with the main voice recognition system.
- Improved noise reduction algorithms.
- Enhanced user interface for phrase testing.
